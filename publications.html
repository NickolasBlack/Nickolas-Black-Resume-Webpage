                Foxconn Technology Group Quantiative Research
            </a>

            <p class="description">
                This study analyzes Foxconn Technology Group’s transition from a consumer electronics manufacturer 
                to a contract manufacturer in the automotive and electric vehicle (EV) industry. Using historical stock data, 
                the analysis applies exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, feature engineering, machine learning, 
                financial risk assessment, and trading strategy evaluation to determine whether Foxconn’s stock aligns more 
                closely with technology or automotive firms. <br><br>
                
                Correlation analysis reveals weak links with technology clients but strong relationships with 
                Asian automotive manufacturers such as Nissan, Honda, and Hyundai, motivating feature engineering for 
                predictive modeling. Supervised machine learning models, including linear regression on normalized closing prices, 
                achieve moderate accuracy, suggesting Foxconn’s market behavior increasingly reflects automotive dynamics. 
                Financial risk analysis, including volatility, daily and log returns, and Value at Risk (VaR), indicates reduced 
                volatility but ongoing downside exposure. A dual moving average trading strategy shows limited profitability, 
                reinforcing the view that Foxconn remains a high-risk investment. <br><br>

                Overall, the findings highlight that Foxconn’s strategic shift toward automotive manufacturing has altered its 
                stock behavior, increasing stability while maintaining significant financial risk, and provide a foundation for 
                further research into supply chain effects and long-term valuation impacts.<br><br>

                Jersey City Citbike Data Science Project
            </a>
            <p class="description">
               This study analyzes Citi Bike usage in Jersey City during the first quarter of 2020 using publicly available trip data.
               Citi Bike is a bicycle-sharing system that allows users to rent bikes via annual memberships or single-ride passes, 
               with over 600 docking stations across the NYC metropolitan area.<br><br>

                The primary objectives are to identify neighborhoods with the highest bike traffic, estimate the average age of users, 
                determine the top ten venues in high-traffic areas, and cluster neighborhoods using k-means to uncover usage patterns. 
                The analysis serves bicycle enthusiasts considering relocation and businesses seeking strategic advertising locations.<br><br>

                Data from NYC Open Data and the Foursquare API is used to construct datasets containing trip details, user demographics,
                station information, and local venues. Exploratory analysis shows the average trip lasts approximately 30 minutes, 
                with the typical rider born in 1979 (around 41 years old). Clustering neighborhoods by usage intensity reveals structural 
                similarities in biking behavior.<br><br>

                Overall, the study demonstrates how urban mobility data can inform business strategy, urban planning, and community engagement 
                within shared transportation systems.<br><br>
