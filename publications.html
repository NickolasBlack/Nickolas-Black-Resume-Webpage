                This document presents a comprehensive financial and data-driven analysis of Foxconn Technology Group, 
                examining its transition from a consumer electronics manufacturer to a contract manufacturer within 
                the automotive and electric vehicle (EV) industry. 

                Using historical stock price data, the study applies exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, 
                feature engineering, machine learning, financial risk management, and trading strategy evaluation to 
                assess whether Foxconn’s stock behavior aligns more closely with technology firms or automotive manufacturers.

                The analysis begins with an exploratory examination of Foxconn’s Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) prices to 
                identify trends, volatility, and structural shifts over time. Correlation analysis is then performed between 
                Foxconn and its major technology clients, revealing weak or negative relationships, while stronger correlations 
                emerge with Asian automotive manufacturers such as Nissan, Honda, and Hyundai. These findings motivate a focused 
                feature engineering process that isolates automotive-related variables for predictive modeling.

                Normalized closing prices are used to construct supervised machine learning models, including linear regression, 
                to predict Foxconn’s stock performance based on its automotive partners. The resulting models achieve moderate predictive accuracy, 
                suggesting that Foxconn’s market behavior increasingly reflects automotive industry dynamics, particularly after 2018.

                Financial risk management techniques are applied to evaluate volatility, daily returns, logarithmic returns, a
                nd Value at Risk (VaR), providing quantitative insight into the potential downside risk associated with holding
                Foxconn stock. The analysis indicates reduced volatility over time but continued exposure to significant downside risk, 
                consistent with the low-margin and cyclical nature of the automotive sector.

                Finally, a dual moving average trading strategy is implemented and backtested to assess the feasibility of technical trading approaches
                on Foxconn stock. Results show limited profitability, reinforcing the conclusion that Foxconn remains a high-risk investment despite improved stability.

                Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that Foxconn’s strategic shift toward automotive manufacturing has materially
                altered its stock behavior. While the transition has increased stability and alignment with automotive firms, significant 
                financial risks remain. The findings highlight the importance of sector-specific dynamics in evaluating corporate transformations 
                and offer a foundation for future research into supply chain effects, strategic timing, and long-term valuation impacts.

                Jersey City Citbike Data Science Project
            </a>

                This document presents a data-driven analysis of Citi Bike usage in Jersey City using publicly available trip data from the first quarter of
                2020. Citi Bike operates as a bicycle-sharing system that allows users to purchase either an annual membership or a single-ride pass, granting 
                up to 45 minutes of bicycle use per rental before additional charges are incurred. With over 600 docking stations across the New York City metropolitan area, 
                the system provides a flexible and widely accessible transportation option for urban commuters and recreational cyclists.

                The primary objective of this project is to identify patterns in Citi Bike usage across Jersey City neighborhoods. Specifically, the analysis seeks
                to determine which neighborhoods experience the highest levels of bicycle traffic, estimate the average age of Citi Bike users, identify the top ten venues 
                located within high-traffic biking areas, and cluster neighborhoods using k-means clustering to uncover structural similarities in usage patterns.

                This project is designed to serve two main audiences: bicycle enthusiasts considering relocation to Jersey City and bicycle-related businesses 
                seeking strategic locations for advertising and outreach. Demographic analysis of user data provides insight into the characteristics of the
                Citi Bike user base, enabling advertisers to better target their marketing efforts. Geographic and station-level analysis offers cyclists valuable
                information about bike availability, popular neighborhoods, and opportunities to engage with other members of the biking community.

                The analysis is conducted using multiple data sources. First, Citi Bike trip metadata from NYC Open Data is used to construct a comprehensive 
                dataset containing trip duration, start and stop times, station information, geographic coordinates, user type, gender, and year of birth. 
                Second, neighborhood-level data is enriched using the Foursquare API to identify the most common venues within areas of high Citi Bike traffic.

                Exploratory data analysis reveals several key insights. The average Citi Bike trip in Jersey City lasts approximately 30 minutes, 
                indicating that most rides are well within the allotted rental window. The presence of very short trips suggests potential noise 
                in the data, possibly caused by equipment issues or accidental rentals. Demographic analysis shows that the average Citi Bike user 
                was born in 1979, placing the typical rider at approximately 41 years of age during the study period.

                Finally, clustering techniques are applied to group neighborhoods based on usage intensity and geographic characteristics. 
                These clusters provide a structured understanding of Citi Bike activity across Jersey City and highlight areas with similar
                biking behaviors. Overall, this document demonstrates how urban mobility data can be leveraged to inform business decisions,
                urban planning, and community engagement within shared transportation systems.
